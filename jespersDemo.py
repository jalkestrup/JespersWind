Traveling through rivers and across mountain tops will result in a shorter route but will present other risks that might endanger your travel. The route is entirely up to you to decide, after having traveled a distance equal to one pin you will select in what direction the caravan should head next. Each pin equals a distance of 30 miles and will take several days to travel dependent on weather conditions, the health of your oxen, state of your wagon and the geography in the area. Press down on a pin next to your starting position to select an initial direction. Once selected it will slowly pulsate along with your previously traveled route. Once ready to start your travel, press the Continue travel pin positioned left most, to start your journey or use some of the other options to buy additional supplies, interact with people or start hunting.")
